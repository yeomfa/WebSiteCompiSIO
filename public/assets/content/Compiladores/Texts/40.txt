A compiler is a program which coverts the entire source code of a programming
language into executable machine code for a CPU. <br>
Compiler takes large amount of time to analyze the entire source code but the overall
execution time of the program iscomparatively faster. <br>
Compiler generates the error message only after scanning the whole program, so debugging is comparatively hard as the error. <br>
can be present any where in the program.Generates intermediate object code.
Examples: C, C++, Java. <br>
Columnas 2. <br><br>
interpreter takes a source program and runs it line by line, translating each line as it comes to it
Interpreter takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time of the program is slower. <br>
Its Debugging is easier as it continuestranslating the program until the error is met
No intermediate object code is generated. <br>
Examples: Python, Perl. <br>
